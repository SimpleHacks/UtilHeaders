This repo provides header files that provide utility for `C` and `C++`
projects.  Each header has its own markdown file:

* [CompileDate.h](./CompileDate.h) - Provides `constexpr` compliant
  macros to get integers corresponding to the compilate date / time.
  See [CompileDate.md](./CompileDate.md) for more details.
* [ArraySize2.h](./ArraySize2.h) - Provides a type-safe, `constexpr` compliant
  macros to get the count of elements in a statically-allocated array.
  See [ArraySize2.md](./ArraySize2.md) for more details.

# Enjoy!
